## Dispatcher/Operator Telephone board / Electronic Speech Telephone Network board (ASTN)

(Designed by MRCS)

The Electronic Speech Telephone Network (ASTN) board provides the
electronics and connections for building a telephone for a Dispatcher
or Operator for use with a model railroad telephone system using
either a microphone/speaker/footswitch arrangement or using an
inexpensive computer headset.  The Mic/Speaker/Foot switch arrangement
is recommended where the dispatcher or operator will be in a
sound-isolated environment and the headset (preferably noise
cancelling) is recommended for Operators and Dispatchers who will
be in the layout room.  Features include:

  * Supports either Dynamic or Electret microphones
  * Independent control of outbound, inbound and "break-in" volume
  * Break in volume is the level heard by the user when depressing the footswitch (prototype train order operators would break in if there was an error during an order or repeat as a safety measure)
  * Can be used to "modernize" a classic candlestick type phone for better performance in a noisy layout room
  * supports mono or stereo inputs and outputs
  * optional phase reversal on output to help tune maximum volume without feedback
  * No DC load on the dispatcher's line
  * line level output for powered speakers or input to an external amplifier
  * uses 24 VDC
  * optional remote volume controls
  * transmit LED indicator
